Convert Property Rental Paper Contract into a Smart Contract.



Contract Definition:-

It is a contract between a landlord and tenant. The purpose of the contract is to make sure that rent is paid on time. 

The contract functions as follows:

1)The landlord initiates the contract by setting up the monthly rent and the house address and then the state of the contract is set to “Created”.

2)Tenant signs the contract and the tenure begins and the state of the contract is set to “Started”.

3) When the state is “Started” the agreement can not be confirmed again, thus eliminating 
the possibility of overwriting the current tenant.

5) When the landlord terminates the contract the state is set to “Terminated”.

6) Provide restrictions to the state of “Terminated”  if to goes passed a certain date 

7) Notice period goes up after length of time tenant staying there goes up.
